# gobblet-gobblers
A version of a board game similar to Gobblet Gobblers, an advanced form of Tic-Tac-Toe where players can place larger pieces on smaller ones. Unlike standard Tic-Tac-Toe, where the goal is simply to align three identical marks in a row, this version adds complexity with three different sizes of pieces - small, medium, and large - that can be stacked on top of each other depending on their size. The game involves two players, called yellow and red, and the pieces differ in color and size. The goal of the game is to align three pieces of any size in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
